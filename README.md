# README.md

This is the README file for the `question_mongo.ipynb` notebook.

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to use MongoDB with Python to answer questions. It includes examples of how to connect to a MongoDB database, query data, and perform basic data analysis.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need to install the following packages:

- `pymongo`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

You can install these packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -q -r '/content/drive/MyDrive/OpenAI/Q&A_model/pinecone_solve/requirements.txt'
```

## Setup

Before running the notebook, you will need to mount your Google Drive and set up the `mongo_uri` variable.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

mongo_uri = 'mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
```

Replace `username`, `password`, `cluster`, and `database` with your own MongoDB credentials.

## Usage

The notebook is divided into several sections:

1. **Connect to MongoDB**: This section demonstrates how to connect to a MongoDB database using the `pymongo` library.
2. **Query Data**: This section demonstrates how to query data from a MongoDB collection using various query operators.
3. **Data Analysis**: This section demonstrates how to perform basic data analysis using `numpy` and `pandas`.
